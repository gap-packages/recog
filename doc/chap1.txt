  [33X[0;0YThis  package is about group recognition. It provides a generic framework to
  implement  methods  of  group  recognition, regardless of what computational
  representation  is used. This means, that the code in this package is useful
  at  least  for  permutation  groups, and matrix groups and projective groups
  over finite fields. The setup is described in [NS06].[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  framework allows to build composition trees and handles the builtup and
  usage  of  these trees in a generic way. It also contains a method selection
  (described  in  Chapter  [14X4[114X)  that allows to install recognition methods in a
  convenient  way  and that automatically tries to try the different available
  methods in a sensible order.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.2 [33X[0;0YOverview over this manual[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YChapter [14X2[114X describes the installation of this package.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YChapter  [14X3[114X  describes  the  generic,  recursive  procedure  used  for  group
  recognition  throughout  this package. At the heart of this procedure is the
  definition  of  [21XFindHomomorphism[121X  methods,  which  is also described in that
  chapter.  For  the choice of the right method for finding a homomorphism (or
  an isomorphism) we use another generic procedure, the [21Xmethod selection[121X which
  is not to be confused with the [5XGAP[105X method selection.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YOur own method selection system is described in detail in Chapter [14X4[114X, because
  it   is  interesting  in  its  own  right  and  might  be  useful  in  other
  circumstances.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YChapter [14X6[114X describes the available [21XFindHomomorphism[121X methods.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YChapter [14X5[114X explains what one can do with a completed recognition tree.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFinally,  Chapter  [14X7[114X  shows  some  instructive examples of the usage of this
  package.[133X

  [33X[0;0YIn  addition,  the [5Xrecog[105X package has a mailing list, at recog@gap-system.org
  ([7Xmailto:recog@gap-system.org[107X),  which  can  be used for holding discussions,
  sharing  information,  and  asking questions about the package. You can find
