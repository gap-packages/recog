This package is about group recognition. It provides a generic
framework to implement methods of group recognition, regardless of
what computational representation is used. This means, that the code
in this package is useful at least for permutation groups, matrix
groups and projective groups.
The setup is described in <Cite Key="IssacRecog"/>. <P/>

The framework allows to build composition trees and handles the builtup
and usage of these trees in a generic way. It also contains a
method selection (described in Chapter <Ref Chap="methsel"/>) that allows
install recognition methods in a convenient way and that automatically
tries to try the different available methods in a sensible order.

Chapter <Ref Chap="install"/> describes the installation of this package.<P/>

Chapter <Ref Chap="recognition"/> describes the generic, recursive procedure
used for group recognition throughout this package. At the heart of this
procedure is the definition of <Q>FindHomomorphism</Q> methods, which is also
described in that chapter. For the choice of the right method for finding a
homomorphism (or an isomorphism) we use another generic procedure, the
<Q>method selection</Q> which is not to be confused with the &GAP; method
selection.<P/>

Our own method selection is described in detail in Chapter <Ref
Chap="methsel"/>, because it is interesting in its own right and might be
useful in other circumstances.<P/>

Chapter <Ref Chap="methods"/> describes the avalable <Q>FindHomomorphism</Q>
methods.<P/>

Chapter <Ref Chap="afterrecog"/> explains what one can do with a
completed recognition tree.<P/>

Finally, Chapter <Ref Chap="examples"/> shows instructive examples for the
usage of this package.<P/>
