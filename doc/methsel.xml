<Chapter Label="methsel">
<Heading>Method selection</Heading>

The setup described in this chapter is intended for situations, in which
lots of different methods are available to fulfill a certain task, but
in which it is not possible in the beginning to decide, which one to use.
Therefore this setup regulates, rather than just which method to choose,
in which order the various methods are tried. The methods themselves
return whether they were successful and, if not, whether it is sensible
to try them again at a later stage.<P/>

The design is intentionally kept as simple as possible and at the same
time as versatile as possible, thereby providing a useful framework
for many situations as described above.<P/>

Note the differences to the &GAP; method selection, which is designed
with the idea in mind that it will be quite clear in most
situations, which one is <Q>the best</Q> method for a given set of
input data, and that we do not want to try different things. On the other
hand, the &GAP; method selection is quite complicated, which is to some
extend necessary to make sure, that lots of different information about
the objects in question can be used to really find the best method.<P/>

Our setup here in particular has to fulfill the requirement, that in the
end, with lots of methods installed, one still has to be able to have
an overview and to <Q>prove</Q>, that the whole system always does
the right thing.<P/>

    <Heading>What are methods?</Heading>

A method is just a &GAP; function together with an agreement about
what arguments it takes and what result it returns. The agreement
about the arguments of course has to be made for every situation
in which this generic method selection code is used, and the
user is completely free there. A method can (and has to) return
one of the following four values:<P/>

<List>
<Mark><K>Success</K></Mark>
<Item>means that the method was successful and no more methods have to be
    tried.</Item>
<Mark><K>NeverApplicable</K></Mark>
<Item>means that the method was not successful and that there is no point
    to call the method again in this situation whatsoever.</Item>
<Mark><K>TemporaryFailure</K></Mark>
<Item>means that the method temporarily failed, that it however could be
    sensible to call it again in this situation at a later stage. This
    value is typical for a Las Vegas algorithm using randomised methods,
    which has failed, but which may succeed when called again.</Item>
<Mark><K>NotEnoughInformation</K></Mark>
<Item>means that the method for some reason refused to do its work. However,
    it is possible that it will become applicable later such that it makes
    sense to call it again, for example when more information is available.</Item>
</List>

For administration in the method selection, a method is described by
a record with the following components bound:

<List>
<Mark><C>method</C></Mark>
<Item>holds the function itself.</Item>
<Mark><C>rank</C></Mark>
<Item>holds an integer used to sort the various methods. Higher numbers
    mean that the method is tried earlier. The numbering scheme is left
    to the user.
</Item>
<Mark><C>stamp</C></Mark>
<Item>holds a string value that uniquely describes the method. This is used
    for bookkeeping and to keep track of what has to be tried how often.
</Item>
<Mark><C>comment</C></Mark>
<Item>a string valued comment. This field is optional and can be left out.
</Item>
</List>

The different methods for a certain task are collected in so-called
<Q>method databases</Q>. A <E>method database</E> is just a list of records,
each describing a method in the format described above. During method selection,
the methods are tried in the order in which they are stored in the database.
Thus they should be stored in rank-descending order.<P/>

There is one convenience function to put a new method into a method database:

<#Include Label="AddMethod">
</Section>

<Section Label="howcalled">
    <Heading>How methods are called</Heading>

Whenever the method selection shall be used, one calls the following
function:

<#Include Label="CallMethods">
</Section>
