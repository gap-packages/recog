<Heading>Methods for generic groups</Heading>

The following methods can be equally applied to permutation, matrix and
projective groups. We do not refer to them as black-box groups here, as
they are allowed to contain code that only works for inputs of the
listed types.

<Section Label="permmethods">
<Heading>Methods for permutation groups</Heading>

The following table gives an overview over the installed methods and their
rank (higher rank means higher priority, the method is tried earlier, see
Chapter <Ref Chap="methsel"/>).

<Section Label="matrixmethods">
<Heading>Methods for matrix groups</Heading>

The following table gives an overview over the installed methods and their
rank (higher rank means higher priority, the method is tried earlier, see
Chapter <Ref Chap="methsel"/>). Note
that there are not that many methods for matrix groups since the
system can switch to projective groups by dividing out the subgroup
of scalar matrices. The bulk of the recognition methods are then
installed es methods for projective groups.

<Section Label="projmethods">
<Heading>Methods for projective groups</Heading>

The following table gives an overview over the installed methods and their
rank (higher rank means higher priority, the method is tried earlier, see
Chapter <Ref Chap="methsel"/>). Note
that the recognition for matrix group switches to projective recognition
rather soon in the recognition process such that most recognition methods
in fact are installed as methods for projective groups.
