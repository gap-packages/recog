This file describes changes in the recog package.

1.4.4 (2025-01-DD)
  - Fix an unexpected error during recognition when trying to split
    group as direct products (in `RECOG.DirectFactorsFinder`)
  - Fix an unexpected error in `RECOG.SmallHomomorphicImageProjectiveGroup`
  - Fix an unexpected error in the C6 recognition code (a call to
    `ConvertToMatrixRep` was missing)
  - Remove left-over debug message which sometimes printed "With 2" or
    similar messages during recognition

1.4.3 (2024-10-16)
  - Stop overriding the system library function `MTX.InvariantBilinearForm`
    with an old version (this was meant to fix a bug in GAP but has been
    unnecessary for a couple years, and now impedes improvements for this
    function in GAP)
  - Various internal and janitorial changes

1.4.2 (2022-09-27)
  - Fix more compatibility issues with matgrp <= 0.70
  - Rename `order` to `OrderFunc` to avoid clashes with existing code
  - Speed up default test suite

1.4.1 (2022-09-26)
  - Fix compatibility with matgrp <= 0.70

1.4.0 (2022-09-26)
  - A huge number of changes (over 388 commits since the previous release)
    were made, with many bug fixes and improvements, but also renamed APIs
    and more. Unfortunately this may break some code using recog. If this
    happens to, you, please let us know about it via our issue tracker
    <https://github.com/gap-packages/recog/issues> or by sending and email
    to Max Horn <mhorn@rptu.de>.

1.3.2 (2019-04-15)
  - Many janitorial changes

1.3.1 (2018-09-18)
  - Fix some test cases
  - Disable more dead code
  - More minor changes

1.3 (2018-09-16)
  - Requires GAP >= 4.9
  - Merge the recogbase package into recog
  - Remove tons of unused code & files
  - Add many comments throughout the codebase (e.g. notes on the origin
    of some algorithms; FIXME and TODO remarks; ...)
  - Fix many bugs in the recognition code leading to errors or incorrect recognitions
  - Replace involution finder for SL_2 in even characteristic (faster & less buggy)
  - Add more tests
  - Set up continuous integration using Travis CI, to ensure new code changes
    are immediately tested for regressions
  - Introduce self-explanatory names for recognition method results
    (true -> Success, false -> NeverApplicable, fail -> TemporaryFailure,
    NotApplicable -> NotEnoughInformation); this revealed various bugs where
    the wrong values were returned
  - Refactor CallMethods, to make it easier to understand and work on
  - Improve the documentation; in particular, the tables of recognition methods
    with their rankings are now generated from the code, and thus are always
    up-to-date (previously, they were from that)
  - Add Randomize methods for non-compressed vectors to support fields with more than 256 elements (fixes issue #15)
  - Many other small changes, cleanups, etc.

1.2.5 (2016-03-08)
  - Maintenance release

1.2.4 (2016-01-07)

  - Fix bug leading to "Error: Group() called with empty list of generators" (see issue #5)
  - Workaround for problem with L2(31) (see issue #6)
  - Fix endless loop when recognizing GL(2,q) with q <= 32 (see issue #9)
  - Detect if DoHintedLowIndex runs into an infinite loop
  - Add various source code comments
  - Move FindKernelLowerLeftPGroup from recogbase to recog
  - Move website to https://gap-packages.github.io/recog/
  - Update documentation
