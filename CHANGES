This file describes changes in the recog package.

1.3.2 (2019-04-15)
  - Many janitorial changes

1.3.1 (2018-09-18)
  - Fix some test cases
  - Disable more dead code
  - More minor changes

1.3 (2018-09-16)
  - Requires GAP >= 4.9
  - Merge the recogbase package into recog
  - Remove tons of unused code & files
  - Add many comments throughout the codebase (e.g. notes on the origin
    of some algorithms; FIXME and TODO remarks; ...)
  - Fix many bugs in the recognition code leading to errors or incorrect recognitions
  - Replace involution finder for SL_2 in even characteristic (faster & less buggy)
  - Add more tests
  - Set up continuous integration using Travis CI, to ensure new code changes
    are immediately tested for regressions
  - Introduce self-explanatory names for recognition method results
    (true -> Success, false -> NeverApplicable, fail -> TemporaryFailure,
    NotApplicable -> NotEnoughInformation); this revealed various bugs where
    the wrong values were returned
  - Refactor CallMethods, to make it easier to understand and work on
  - Improve the documentation; in particular, the tables of recognition methods
    with their rankings are now generated from the code, and thus are always
    up-to-date (previously, they were from that)
  - Add Randomize methods for non-compressed vectors to support fields with more than 256 elements (fixes issue #15)
  - Many other small changes, cleanups, etc.

1.2.5 (2016-03-08)
  - Maintenance release

1.2.4 (2016-01-07)
  - Fix bugs with handling of scalars in projective matrix groups (see issues #2 and #4)
  - Fix misdetection of SL(2,q), odd q (see issue #3)
  - Fix bug leading to "Error: Group() called with empty list of generators" (see issue #5)
  - Workaround for problem with L2(31) (see issue #6)
  - Fix endless loop when recognizing GL(2,q) with q <= 32 (see issue #9)
  - Detect if DoHintedLowIndex runs into an infinite loop
  - Add various source code comments
  - Move FindKernelLowerLeftPGroup from recogbase to recog
  - Move website to http://gap-packages.github.io/recog/
  - Update documentation
  - Splits some large source files into multiple
  - Remove lots of unused code and files
