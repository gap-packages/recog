Use other methods for going down in dimension 3 in SL code

Finalize FindAllPPD method


Today:

  - Look at documentation: StdGens, StdPresentation
  - Bug with loading of single packages
  - Systematic test of classical natural
  - Tensor und Subfield tests fail because SL(4,5) does not find an SL2
  - Use RECOG.RandomSubProduct everywhere
  - eMail Alice because of deleted perm rep A_n
  - Look at all PseudoRandoms (still TODO)
  - nonconstructive Lie type
  - decide about names for attributes
  - revisit examples/challenges
  - balanced trees
  - fix new FindElmOf method with respect to PseudoRandom
  - implement sl2 natural
  - look at Pete's code (blackbox classical)
  - DisplayCompositionFactors is seriously broken e.g. in the projective
    case


  - Alice+Steve fuer Sn auf k-sets

Later TODO list:

  - implement sl2 natural for odd characteristic
  - early cheap stabchain method? --> first groundwork in genss
  - look at Pete's code (blackbox classical)
  - balanced trees
  - Investigate maxdepth behaviour and length of SLPs, sensible?
  - FindSL2 does not work for q=5, ==> SL(6,5) does not work (FindSL2)
    reason: we power up to order 4, square of y is -1 thus y and z=y^x
            mod -1 is dihedral rather than SL(2,5)
  - DisplayCompositionFactors is seriously broken e.g. in the projective
    case
  - look at AltSymBB for next rep up if deleted perm went wrong?
  - Look at Product Replacers again (--> orb): no need for accus during mixing
  - implement classical natural for odd case (--> LG OB)
  - genss: Make call to StabilizerChain which is guaranteed to be quick
    possible
  - more reps for specific hint (-> covers and non-atlasrep reps)
  - think about BrauerCharacterValue method
  - adjoint rep of sl_n
  - verification/presentations
  - example12 needs extremely long, why?
  - Cleanup matrix.gi (e.g. remove det code)
 - Pete Sp -> send mail
 - PCGS with memory: Luks, Murray, Cooperman implementation
 - Hash functions for vectors over finite fields 257 <= q <= 65536
   -> NumberFFVector
 - do more C9 cases

========================================================================

Future:

improvements of library in library

to change once the new vector/matrix interface is in place:

  FieldOfMatrixGroup/DefaultFieldOfMatrixGroup

From former recogbase TODO:

If isomorphism: calc preimages "rascher"
Calculating preimages: Bessere Anzeige wie viele...

========================================================================

Future:

Think whether the changing of gensN after creation might hurt other
places than LowerLeftPGroup.

SLPforElement methods without evaluation --> like in SiftAsWord ???

IsMember for (ri,x) recursively
Make things into functions???

========================================================================

to talk ???:

  Convention: SLPforElement guarantees that a returned slp does the job
    ==> \in is easier, does not have to evaluate the slp
    ==> in StabChain code we divide up labels
    ==> in Hom code we divide up preimage of the image, go to kernel
    ==> doable everywhere (in fact done everywhere)

  FindKernelFastNormalClosure always?
